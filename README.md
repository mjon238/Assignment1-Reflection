#Michael Jones Assignment 1 Reflection

This assignment was actually more useful than I expected. 

  The psuedocode tasks really consolidated my knowledge on the subject and taught me how to better apply what I learnt. This will be useful for the upcoming test in two weeks
  
  The task to research some coding strategy was also useful. I had forgotten a lot from the lectures on this subject, and the tasks helped me really understand one of the coding strategies (decrease and conquer). Before the test I'll begin looking into all of strategies.
  
  Overall this assignment was a good one and helped me apply what we've been doing in labs and in lectures the past few weeks.
